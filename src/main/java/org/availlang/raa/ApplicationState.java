/**
 * A {@code ApplicationState} describes the current state of the running
 * application.
 *
 * <p>
 * <em>NOTE:</em> This could be extended to make it more like a state machine
 * that knows its next acceptable states. Each state change location would need
 * to be evaluated to see what valid state transitions there might be. The
 * enum then could be extended to answer the acceptable state transitions
 * and have them be checked at each transition. I obviously didn't do this...
